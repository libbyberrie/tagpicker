A fork off the existing Frontend Engineer task repo from Rasely

## A couple of notes:

- Instead of using the frameworks libraries i'm most used to (Vue/Tailwind/Gridsome) i made the (ill-advised?) decision to take this as a learning opportunity to re-learn and refresh React. This will give you a better idea of what my work will be like at the beginning while i'm still learning. However, for transparency's sake i should mention that **this project did not take 4 hours as I was essentially re-learning on the job**. I would estimate this project took closer to 10-12 hours to complete, across a few days.

- **There appears to be two contributors in the repo - that's because i forgot to change the github account connected to my machine's sites folder from a business account to my personal account**. I had amended the commit history for the merge into main but because i had squashed and closed the branch, i can't find an easy way to reattribute the authors for those commits,
